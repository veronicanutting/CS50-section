# Programming 101

---

## Programming vs. Coding?
* "Coding, as the word suggests, is involved in writing code. A coder translates the requirements into the programming language of his choice and writes lines of codes. Programming, on the other hand, is a much broader term that involves coding AND other tasks like problem solving, critical thinking, conceptualizing, and understanding algorithms and data structures.""
    * Nicholas Hargreaves in [this](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-programming-and-coding-4) Quora discussion)

## Getting Help and Helping Yourself
* Use CS50's [resources](https://veronicanutting.github.io/section/resources) and [tools](https://veronicanutting.github.io/section/tools)!
* Google stuff!
    * a lot of people are worried about [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/2018/fall/syllabus/#academic-honesty)
        * my rule of thumb: don't Google anything with "CS50" or the problem set's name or "Harvard" or anything else that might take you directly to something "[unreasonable](https://cs50.harvard.edu/2018/fall/syllabus/#academic-honesty)"
            * if you stumble upon something "unreasonable" by accident/indirectly, best to reach out to heads
            * and if you make a mistake and do something unreasonable, also email heads
    * all of that^^ being said, there are tons of things you can Google that are aok (and even recommended!)
        * some of my favorite sites to lean on are: [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and Quora discussions, [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com) materials, and Khan Academy and Codecademy
* Collaborate with your peers! (in a "reasonable" way)

## Design
Below are some good questions to ask yourself when thinking about design:
* Is there repetition that could be eliminated?
* Are there unnecessary loops?
* Is my code scalable?
